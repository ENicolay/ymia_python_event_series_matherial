# Bio-image Analysis Code Generation using bia-bob

In this folder you find the notebooks discussed in the session about code generation for bio-image analysis using [bia-bob](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/bia-bob).
The slides accompanying this session can be found [on zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/13908108).

In order to run those notebooks, you need to obtain and store an API Key as explained [here](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/bia-bob?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-api-keys).

Furthermore, you need to setup a conda environment like this:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

You can then activate the environment:
```
conda activate bob-env
```

And start Jupyter lab:
```
jupyter lab
```
